# Current State of UX in Web3
The user experience in Web3 has historically lagged behind that of traditional web applications, primarily due to the complexity and novelty of blockchain technologies. Common issues include:

- Complexity for Users: Interacting with DApps often requires understanding of new concepts like gas fees, transaction confirmations, and public/private keys.
- Fragmented Ecosystem: A variety of wallets and blockchains can lead to compatibility issues and a steep learning curve.
- Security Concerns: The high stakes involved in transactions (due to the irreversible nature of blockchain) add stress and demand high vigilance from users.

## How EIP-6963 Moves the Goalposts
EIP-6963 represents an attempt to standardize the way wallet providers are detected and interacted with, which could have several positive implications for UX in Web3:

- Simplified Integration: By providing a standardized way to announce and detect wallet providers, developers can more easily integrate multiple wallets into their applications, reducing the effort and potential errors involved in supporting diverse wallet ecosystems.
- Enhanced User Confidence: Standardization can lead to more predictable and familiar interfaces and interactions, which help in building user trust and confidence.
- Cross-Wallet Compatibility and Discovery: A standard protocol for wallet detection and interaction promotes better interoperability between different ecosystems, potentially offering users a smoother and more integrated experience.

Suggestions and Final Thoughts
As you continue to develop your Web3 applications, keep focusing on user-centric design. Consider the following:

- User Education: Since many users are still new to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, integrating educational tools and clear guidance within the application can enhance the user experience.
- Testing Across Wallets: Ensure thorough testing with different wallets and environments to minimize user issues due to unexpected behaviors or incompatibilities.
- Feedback Loops: Implement mechanisms to gather user feedback regularly to adapt and improve the application's usability continually.

EIP-6963 is a promising step towards a more unified and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. By simplifying interactions between DApps and wallets, it helps in paving the way for a smoother user experience, which is crucial for broader adoption and acceptance of blockchain technologies. 

Your engagement with such standards not only prepares your projects for future scalability but also aligns them with evolving best practices in the space.

# Current State of UX in Web3
The user experience in Web3 has historically lagged behind that of traditional web apps, primarily due to the complexity and novelty of blockchain technologies. 

We need to remind ourselves that the full picture of Web3 is still unclear. The technology is growing, but it's not fully there yet. Those that are helping us build the future of Web3 through libraries and frameworks and those building dApps have a huge role in ensuring that the tools and applications we build are accessible, usable, and solve a problem for those utilizing the technology.

Understand the common issues and pain points and use the right technology either old or new to help solve these problems. Some technology already exists for making Web2 accessible and usable, and these technologies need to be adapted or built from scratch to serve our web3 ecosystem.

Common issues include:

- Complex Concepts: Using DApps require understanding new concepts like gas fees, transaction confirmations, and public/private keys.
- Fragmented Ecosystem: A variety of wallets and blockchains can lead to compatibility issues and a steep learning curve.
- Security Concerns: High stakes in transactions (due to the irreversible nature of blockchain) add stress and demand high vigilance.
- UI/UX Technology Concerns: Outside of the technology that exists for Web2, the primitives, libraries, and frameworks are still being developed and are in their early stages.

## How EIP-6963 Moves the Goalposts
EIP-6963 represents an attempt to standardize the way wallet providers are detected and interacted with, which could have several positive implications for UX in Web3:

- Simplified Integration: By providing a standardized way to announce and detect wallet providers, developers can more easily integrate multiple wallets into their applications, reducing the effort and potential errors involved in supporting a diverse wallet ecosystem.
- Enhanced User Confidence: Standardization can lead to more predictable and familiar interfaces and interactions, which help in building user trust and confidence.
- Cross-Wallet Compatibility and Discovery: A standard protocol for wallet detection and interaction promotes better interoperability between different ecosystems, potentially offering users a smoother and more integrated experience.

Suggestions and Final Thoughts
As you continue to develop your Web3 applications, keep focusing on user-centric design. 

Consider the following:

- User Education: Since many users are new to blockchain, integrate educational tools and clear guidance to enhance the user experience.
- Testing Across Wallets: Test different wallets and environments to minimize UX issues from unexpected behaviors or incompatibilities.
- Feedback Loops: Implement mechanisms to gather user feedback regularly to  continually adapt and improve you dApp's usability.

EIP-6963 is a promising step towards a more unified and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. By simplifying interactions between DApps and wallets, it helps in paving the way for a smoother user experience, which is crucial for broader adoption and acceptance of blockchain technologies. 

Your engagement with such standards not only prepares your projects for future scalability but also aligns them with evolving best practices in the space.
